Add a new section called "How Simple Is It?" between the "Real Numbers. 90-Person Team" section and the "6 Battle-Tested Playbooks" section. This section demonstrates the dead-simple developer experience.

NEW SECTION: "How Simple Is It?"
Background: Slightly different from other sections (subtle gradient or different shade) to make it stand out as the "aha moment"
Section Headline:
"Your Developers Type This. We Handle Everything Else."
Subheadline:
"No training required. No prompt engineering. Just describe the problem."

LAYOUT: Two-column split (60% left, 40% right on desktop, stacked on mobile)

LEFT SIDE: "The Developer Experience"
Create a mock terminal/chat interface that looks like Windsurf or VS Code command palette:
Style it like a code editor with:

Dark background (#0d1117)
Rounded corners
Top bar with three dots (red, yellow, green) like macOS window
Monospace font

Content inside the terminal:
> /complex-issue

Describe your issue:
"Payment sometimes fails after user clicks pay. 
No error in logs. Happens randomly, ~1 in 20 
transactions. Started after last week's deploy."
Below the terminal, add large bold text:
"That's it. That's the entire interaction."
Below that, smaller text:
"No back-and-forth. No 'can you give me more context?' No prompt engineering. Just describe what's broken like you'd tell a senior dev."

RIGHT SIDE: "What Happens Automatically"
Create a vertical checklist with animated appearance (checkmarks appear one by one on scroll):
✅ Gathers complete context automatically

✅ Traces chronological execution flow
   User clicks → Controller → Service → DB

✅ Identifies race condition in OrderService.java:247

✅ Validates against actual code (no hallucination)

✅ Proposes minimal fix with evidence

✅ Generates tests for the fix
Below the checklist:
"⏱️ 15 minutes from problem to fix"

BOTTOM: Side-by-side comparison cards
Two cards horizontally:
LEFT CARD (dimmed, slight red tint):
Title: "Without DevFlow"
Developer: "Fix this payment bug"
AI: "Maybe check the database connection?"
Developer: "That's not it..."
AI: "Could be a caching issue?"
Developer: "Wrong again"
AI: "What about the API timeout?"

⏱️ 3 hours of guessing
❌ Still no root cause
RIGHT CARD (bright, purple glow/border):
Title: "With DevFlow"
Developer: /complex-issue + description
AI: [Systematic 5-step analysis]
AI: "Root cause: Race condition at line 247"
AI: "Here's the fix + tests"

⏱️ 15 minutes
✅ Done. Verified. Tested.

BOTTOM: Workflow command showcase
Heading: "6 Commands. Every Scenario."
Create 6 pill/chip buttons in a horizontal row (scrollable on mobile):
CommandLabel below/quick-fixKnown bugs/complex-issueMystery bugs/storyNew features/refactorBig changes/testsFull coverage/upgradeDependencies
Style:

Background: rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.15)
Border: 1px solid purple
Text: Purple/violet
Hover: Background fills solid, text turns white
Spacing between pills: 12px


SECTION CTA:
Button: "See It In Action → Book Demo"
Style: Same as other CTAs on page (purple gradient)

VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS:
Terminal mock:

Background: #0d1117
Border: 1px solid #30363d
Border-radius: 12px
Font: monospace (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or system mono)
The /complex-issue text should be highlighted in purple (#a78bfa)
Add a blinking cursor animation at the end

Checklist:

Checkmarks: Green (#10b981)
Text: White
Sub-text (the trace path): Gray, smaller font
Animate on scroll: Each item fades in with 0.2s delay

Comparison cards:

Both cards same size
Left card: opacity 0.7, subtle red border or tint
Right card: full opacity, purple glow (box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.3))

Command pills:

Horizontally scrollable on mobile
Equal spacing
Consistent size
