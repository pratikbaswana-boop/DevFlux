The page should feel like:
- A developer tool dashboard (like VS Code, Linear, Vercel)
- Data-driven and analytical
- Modern, fast, technical
- Trustworthy and professional
- Exciting and energetic (not corporate boring)
- Dark, sleek, powerful

Design inspiration:
- Vercel's landing pages (dark, fast, modern)
- Linear's aesthetic (clean, purposeful)
- Stripe's data visualization
- GitHub's new design language
- Tailwind UI components

Build this as a single-page scroll website with smooth section transitions, strong visual hierarchy, and clear CTAs throughout. Every section should reinforce: "AI tools waste money → Our workflows fix it → Proven results → Easy to start."

Generate complete, production-ready code with all sections, animations, and responsive design.
